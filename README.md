# Getting Started
Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Project Setup
2.	Development server
3.	Running tests
   
# Project Setup

## Prerequisites
 Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can check by running node -v and npm -v (or yarn -v) in your terminal.
 
## Installation

### Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/eSusFarm/eSusInsurers-Web.git](https://github.com/eSusFarm/eSusInsurers-Web.git)

### Navigate to the project directory
cd eSusInsurers-Web

### Install dependencies
npm install

### Build the project
ng build

# Development server

## Start the development server
 ng serve 
 This will start the server and open your application in the default browser, usually at http://localhost:4200/.
 
# Running tests 
Unit tests can be run using the following command:
ng test

# Angular Features
## Component-based architecture 
Angular promotes a modular approach where you break down your application into reusable components. This fosters code organization, maintainability, and faster development.

## Two-way data binding 
This two-way street automatically synchronizes data between your component's model and the view template. Any changes made to one are reflected in the other, simplifying data flow management.

## TypeScript support
Angular leverages TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, that adds static typing for enhanced code reliability and tooling support.

## Dependency Injection (DI)
DI provides a flexible mechanism for managing dependencies between components and services. It promotes loose coupling and testability in your application.

## Routing
Angular offers built-in routing capabilities to define navigation paths within your application. This enables users to seamlessly move between different views or components.

## Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)
The CLI acts as a powerful tool for scaffolding new projects, generating components, and running development and build commands. It streamlines the development workflow.

## Rich ecosystem
Angular enjoys a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and extensions that cater to diverse functionalities. This allows developers to integrate pre-built components and features without reinventing the wheel.

## Progressive Web App (PWA) support
Angular empowers you to create PWAs, which are web applications that offer app-like functionality and can work offline. This enhances user experience and engagement.
