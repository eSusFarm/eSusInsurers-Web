7. Farmers will purchase insurance policies and send requests for crop coverage through the eSusfarm platform, utilizing the convenient USSD interface for accessibility and ease of use.
8. AIC will exercise its authority to review, approve, or reject insurance requests through the intuitive eSusfarm web platform, streamlining the decision-making process.
9. Every action undertaken by AIC concerning insurance claims and requests will be meticulously recorded on the Etherisc blockchain and eSusfarm, ensuring transparency and accountability.
10. eSusfarm will continuously communicate with the Etherisc blockchain via its dedicated API, enabling real-time updates and synchronization of data for all stakeholders involved.
