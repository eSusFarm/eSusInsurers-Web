# Responsible and Ethical AI Use
The eSusFarm project applies AI to support inclusive, transparent, and responsible financial services for smallholder farmers. Our guiding principles are:
## Fairness & Non-Discrimination
- We monitor sex-disaggregated and youth participation metrics.
- We audit models to detect and mitigate gender or socio-economic bias.
- Farmers have an appeal process if they feel decisions are unfair.
## Privacy by Design
- We use **federated learning**: raw farmer data remains local and is not centralized. Only model updates are shared and raw data is discarded after training.
- Data minimization and explicit consent are built into all workflows.
## Explainability
- Each farmer credit/proficiency score includes a plain-language explanation of the top contributing factors.
- Field officers are trained to interpret and communicate these explanations.
## Human Oversight
- Automated triggers are supplemented by human validation (extension officers, agronomists).
- Final financing decisions are reviewable and reversible by humans.
## Do No Harm
- We publish a [Do No Harm](docs/DO_NO_HARM.rst) framework for responsible use.
- We are committed to grievance redress, continuous bias testing, and community co-design.
