1.  eSusfarm will receive crop monitoring index insurance details data
    from AIC through an API, ensuring seamless integration of
    information.
2.  Upon receiving the data, eSusfarm will post it onto the Etherisc
    blockchain, ensuring the integrity and immutability of the
    information.
3.  Leveraging the Etherisc blockchain API, eSusfarm will establish
    communication with the Etherisc blockchain
    (https://github.com/etherisc/esusfarm), facilitating secure and
    transparent data transactions.
4.  Insurance claim process will be handled by Etherisc block chain and
    claims will be processed to the farmers.
5.  All vital details regarding insurance policies, claim requests, and
    updates will be securely stored on the Etherisc blockchain,
    enhancing data security and accessibility.
6.  eSusfarm’s user-friendly web application will serve as an interface
    for AIC, empowering the insurance company to efficiently register
    insurers and manage crop insurance information.
7.  Farmers will purchase insurance policies and send requests for crop
    coverage through the eSusfarm platform, utilizing the convenient
    USSD interface for accessibility and ease of use.
8.  AIC will exercise its authority to review, approve, or reject
    insurance requests through the intuitive eSusfarm web platform,
    streamlining the decision-making process.
9.  Every action undertaken by AIC concerning insurance claims and
    requests will be meticulously recorded on the Etherisc blockchain
    and eSusfarm, ensuring transparency and accountability.
10. eSusfarm will continuously communicate with the Etherisc blockchain
    via its dedicated API, enabling real-time updates and
    synchronization of data for all stakeholders involved.
11. Through this robust and interconnected ecosystem, eSusfarm, AIC, and
